Coding style, etc. There are also a few performance tips in here.


Optimization
------------
What can make this sketch use less CPU, hence be faster:

* make the step size bigger (5 pixels works well)
* make the size of the sketch smaller
* make the brush smaller (especially the eraser)
* avoid using the eraser (it's very slow, since it iterates through the pixels)
* have less brushes
* we could change the code to use P3D renderer for the PGraphics in SprayCan, 
  but then the brush will make the sketch look bad when we redraw over it.
